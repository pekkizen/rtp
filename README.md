# rtp

p.fisher(p)  
Standard Fisher's method using all p-values.  

p.art(K, p)  
p.art is Augmented RTP function from Vsevolozhskaya et al (2019).  

p.tfisher.soft(tau, p)  
Soft thresholding TFisher method from Zhang et al (2020)  

p.tfisher.tpm(tau, p)  
runcated product method (tpm) from Zaykin et al (2002) by TFisfer.  
Solved by TFisfer algorithm  


p.rtp returns Rank Truncated Product p-value.  
This is a fast and robust function selected from  
the other functions presented here. The other  
functions are not worse in any significant way.
